# VOTO-DESKTOP

#### [Created with Voto-Android](https://github.com/NicholasSchweikart/voto-android)

## About
Created in conjunction with Voto-Android, this project targets the classroom environment. It is designed to both replace and improve the current "Clicker" solutions for attendance and mass-voting in large lectures, today.

### Teachers
This software allows for teachers and professors to create their own "Sessions" (a series of questions) that are sent their students to vote upon. This can be used to poll questions on previous assignments or questions during class to see how well the student body is absorbing the lecture.

Teachers and Professors will be able to view live voting data for the current question being answered, as well as previous voting data for questions that already have been answered. Along with this they can view a list of their clients and see which individual client is answering.

Upon completion of a session, the data is exported into a .csv file for future reference of the Teachers and Professors.

### Students
Students will be able to use the Voto-Android application to communicate their votes within the classroom environment. Currently this project is only developed on Android.

Students will connect to the host based on the IP, and can either supply a unique ID of their choosing or none-at-all.

Once connected, students will be able to see the current question live on their device (this will change as the teacher changes the question) and will be able to vote A-E on each.
